# 🗃️ Databases in Distributed Systems

A collection of Python demos that simulate key concepts in distributed databases:

## 🔧 What’s Included

- `file_storage_demo.py`: Distributes files across simulated nodes.
- `relational_vs_nosql.py`: Shows the structure of relational (SQL) vs. non-relational (NoSQL) databases.
- `data_replication_demo.py`: Simulates data replication from a primary node to replica nodes.

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python distributed_database/file_storage.py
python distributed_database/relational_vs_nosql.py
python distributed_database/data_replication.py
