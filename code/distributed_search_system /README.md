# Distributed Search System â€“ Demo

A conceptual simulation of a distributed search engine demonstrating:
- **Inverted Indexing**
- **Sharding**
- **Basic Query Routing**

## Features
- Add documents to distributed shards
- Search queries across multiple nodes
- Simulate index creation and retrieval

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd distributed_search_system
    ```

2. **Run the demo**  
    ```bash
    python search_demo.py
    ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

Follow the on-screen prompts to add documents and perform search queries. The simulation will display how queries are routed and results are aggregated from different shards.
